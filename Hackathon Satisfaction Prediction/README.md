Shinkansen Travel Experience Hackathon Project
Introduction
This project was my submission for the Shinkansen Travel Experience Hackathon, concluding the MIT Data Science and Machine Learning Course. The objective was to predict passenger satisfaction on the Shinkansen Bullet Train, based on their overall travel experience.

Unfortunately, the datasets are proprietary to Great Learning and cannot be shared here, but the Data Dictionary is still included for review.

Models Used
Throughout the hackathon, I experimented with various machine learning models to analyze and predict passenger satisfaction:

Logistic Regression: A foundational model for binary classification tasks.
Decision Tree: Useful for its interpretability and simplicity.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that improves on the decision tree's performance by reducing overfitting.
XGBoost: An efficient and powerful boosting model known for its speed and performance.
Neural Network: A deep learning approach to capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data.
SVM (Support Vector Machine): Effective for high-dimensional spaces and various types of data.
Ensemble Models: Combined predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy.

Features and Highlights
Implementation and comparison of a wide range of machine learning models.
Rigorous data analysis and visualization to understand passenger satisfaction factors.
Exploration of both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques.
Data Sources and Preprocessing
The dataset for this project was centered on the passenger experience with the Shinkansen Bullet Train. The preprocessing included cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

Methodology
The project involved applying different machine learning models to the dataset, each selected to explore a range of techniques learned during the course. The focus was on practical application, model experimentation, and understanding the nuances of each model.

Results and Discussion
This section should summarize the outcomes, insights, and findings from the project. Discuss the performance of different models and any interesting observations made during the analysis.

Conclusion
This first hackathon experience was highly rewarding. I am pleased with the results and the opportunity to apply a variety of models within time constraints, demonstrating the breadth of my learning. In future competitions, I plan to focus on optimizing the best-performing model to enhance outcomes. I'm excited to continue competing and learning in the field of data science.
