We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.\n","\n","--------------\n","## **Context:**\n","--------------\n","\n","Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n","\n","E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n","\n","Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n","\n","----------------\n","## **Objective:**\n","----------------\n","\n","You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n","\n","-----------------------------\n","## **Dataset:**\n","-----------------------------\n","\n","The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n","\n","- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n","- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n","- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n","- **timestamp:** Time of the rating.

The task was challenging due to the vast volume and variety of information available, making it imperative to cut through the clutter and deliver relevant suggestions to enhance customer experience and engagement.\n","\n","The exploration involved various models, including user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, along with a simple rank-based model. The key findings from the model performance metrics indicate that the optimized item-based collaborative filtering model (model_item_item_opt) emerged as the standout performer. It achieved the lowest RMSE (0.7798) and the highest F_1 score (over 90%), suggesting its superiority in both accuracy and balance between precision and recall. This is particularly notable given that the model used a distinct dataset (df_item_based), which had more stringent filtering criteria for products but was more inclusive of users.\n","\n","It's interesting to observe that df_new, which had less aggressive filtering compared to df_final, resulted in significantly better model performance. This suggests that retaining a broader user base in the dataset, even with relatively fewer ratings per user, might be beneficial for model accuracy.\n","\n","The computational intensity of the optimized item-based model, while a concern, is justified by its superior performance. However, the observed instability in results and variance from initial predictions warrants further investigation, potentially indicating overfitting, data leakage, or issues in model generalization.\n","\n","**Business Recommendations**\n","\n","- Implement Optimized Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Prioritize the deployment of the optimized item-based model for its high accuracy and balance in precision and recall.\n","\n","- Diverse Dataset Utilization: Continue using datasets that include a wider range of users, even those with fewer ratings, as they seem to enhance model performance.\n","\n","- Resource Allocation for Computation: Allocate sufficient computational resources for the optimized item-based model, considering its intensive nature but high returns in accuracy.\n","\n","- Further Investigation into Instability: Investigate the cause of the instability in results to ensure consistent and reliable recommendations.\n","\n","- Continuous Model Evaluation and Update: Regularly evaluate the model's performance in real-world scenarios and update it to adapt to changing user preferences and catalog updates.\n","\n","- Additional Data: Explore how additional data regarding user demographics and behavior, and item characteristics, might improve model performance and accuracy."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1-_Kp_an3W52HXT8-5nyPDP6sRz2jQz-N","timestamp":1704481369203},{"file_id":"1ERvxMtBH9I3Q15wtBS93capEFh0PCECy","timestamp":1703443438111}],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
